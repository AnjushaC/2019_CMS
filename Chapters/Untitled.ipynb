    "# Periodic Grids: The DFT and FFT\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn to spectral differentiation on a bounded, periodic grid. This process was stated in the form of an $N \\times N$ matrix operation in the first chapter. Whereas the last chapter dealt with the infinite matrix corresponding to the unbounded grid $h\\Zb$, this chapter develops a practical scheme for computation. Mathematically, there are close connections between the two schemes, and the derivation of our spectral method will follow the same pattern as before. The difference is that the semi-discrete Fourier transform is replaced by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, the requirement of periodicity may suggest that this method has limited relevance for practical problems. Yet periodic grids are surprisingly useful in practice. Often in scientific computing a phenomenon is of interest that is unrelated to boundaries, such as the interactin of solitons in the KdV equation or the behavior of homogeneous turbulence. For such problems, periodic boundary conditions often prove the best choice for computation. In addition, some geometries are physically periodic, such as crystal lattics or rows of turbine blades. Finally, even if the physics is not periodic, the coordinate space may be, as is the case for a $\\theta$ or $\\phi$ variable in a computation invovling polar or spherical coordinates (see Chapter $11$). Indeed, among the most common of all spectral methods are methods that mix periodic grids in one or two angular directions with non-periodic grids in one or two radial or longitudinal directions.\n",
